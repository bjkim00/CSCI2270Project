Field,Description
hwy,"A Unique (3 Number - 1 Letter) Highway Identification Code or Designating for a State Highway, Business Route, U.S. Route or Tolled Facility. Odd numbers typically run North and South and Even numbers typically Run East and West."
dir,Traffic flow direction
bmp,Beginning milepoint
emp,Ending milepoint
length,Length of highway segment (in miles)
region,A Domained Value Element (Region: 1-6) used to identify the Engineering Region number in which the Road Segment is located.
year,Year finished
funCl,"Indicates the functional category and usage limitations of the segment of road, as defined by FHWA, and is broken down between rural and urban areas."
county,Name of the county the road segment lies in
pTyp,"Pavement Type Classifications: 1 - Asphalt, 2 - Asphalt over concrete, 3 - Concrete, 4 - Concrete over asphalt"
trafZ,"Traffic Classifications: 1 - Low (<0.3 million design equivalent single access load [ESAL]), 2 - Medium (0.3 - 3 million ESAL), 3 - High (3 - 10 million ESAL), 4 - Very High (10 - 30 million ESAL), 5 - Very Very High (> 30 million ESAL)"
envZ,"Climate Classifications: 1 - Very cool (< 81 degrees), 2 - Cool (81 - 88), 3 - Moderate (88 - 97), 4 - Hot (>97)"
depth,"Thickness Classifications: 1 - Asphalt <4"" thick or Concrete <8"" thick, 2 - Asphalt <6"" thick or Concrete >=8"" thick, 3 - Asphalt >= 6"" thick"
numLanes,Number of lanes in the road segment
pGrp,"Pavement group, which is a combination of the pavement, traffic, and climate classifications. 1323 means Asphalt, High Traffic, Cool Environment, >= 6"" Thick"
nhs,A Domained Value Element (NHSDesig: 0-9) used to identify whether the Road Segment is designated as being part of the National Highway System. Also contains the text value (added at the end)
iri,International roughness index (IRI) correlates somewhat with human exposure to whole-body vibration in vehicles and thus to perceived ride quality reading for the surface condition in the Primary Direction of Travel. Scaled to a score of 1-100.
rut,A value between 0 and 100 that is used to calculate Remaining Service Life for rutting. A value of 100 indicates .15 inch or less rutting. A value of 50 is the threshold that indicates no more remaining service life. This occurs at an average rut depth of .55 inches.
fatg,The amount of fatigue normalized on a scale of 0-100 (where 0 is the worst pavement in existence and 100 is a perfect pavement)
tran,The amount of transverse cracking normalized on a scale of 0-100 (where 0 is the worst pavement in existence and 100 is a perfect pavement)
long,The amount of logitudinal cracking normalized on a scale of 0-100 (where 0 is the worst pavement in existence and 100 is a perfect pavement)
crbk,The amount of corner breaks normalized on a scale of 0-100 (where 0 is the worst pavement in existence and 100 is a perfect pavement)
dl,"The drivability life, which is the number of years a pavement has left until it is no longer an acceptable driving surface"
dlIdx,For CDOT use
curve,For CDOT use
mtcY,For CDOT use
mtcD,For CDOT use
cond,"Condition of the road: LOW, MODERATE, HIGH"
